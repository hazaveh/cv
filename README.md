# Mahdi Hezaveh CV

This project runs my cv at [https://hazaveh.github.io/cv](https://hazaveh.github.io/cv).

Its a vite project with react teamplate. the information are read from `src/data.json` file.

To run the server simply run:

```
$ npm run dev
```

obviously you can do build as well as publishing it on your own github pages.

The page is print friendly with proper breaking points to make sure the printed version does not look awful.

If you wanna read more about stuff I do check my personal website at [hazaveh.net](https://hazaveh.net)

Cheers üç∫
